# HeadphoneVolumeToggler
Changes the volume when you plug/unplug a device from the audio jack

Developed for people using Realtek HD Audio Manager on a Windows 10 computer.

For some reason, if your computer doesn't already toggle volume settings (>:( stupid laptop) when a new audio device is detected, then use this.
